    "- This would lead to a proliferation of subclasses and code duplication.\n",
    "- Making it harder to maintain the classes. And if you wanted to add new features, you would have to create even more subclasses."

    "# Solution 1 ✨ - Adapter Pattern\n",
    "- Instead of creating many different sub-classes for each logging destination, you can create an Adapter which will make the different logging destinations look like the same file interface the original Logger class expects.\n",
    "- So, now, you can have the single Logger class and create multiple adapters for different logging destinations.\n",

    "## Duck typing\n",
    "Adapter pattern relies on duck typing which means that if an object behaves like a certain type (by having the same methods and attributes), it can be treated as that type, regardless of its actual class (and type and class hierarchy are not checked)."
